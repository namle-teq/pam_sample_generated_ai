# Current Focus

## Active Development Areas
1. Asset CRUD API endpoints
2. Dashboard data visualization
3. Responsive layout refinements
4. Integration and smoke testing
5. Form validation and error handling

## Recent Changes
- Database schema finalized in `lib/schema.ts` with:
  - Users table (email/password auth)
  - Assets table with numeric precision fields
  - Added `purchaseDate` (timestamp) and `notes` (optional text) fields to assets
  - Proper timestamp columns
- API endpoints updated for asset CRUD operations:
  - All endpoints now require authentication (returns 401 if not authenticated)
  - Asset creation (POST) now supports `purchaseDate` and `notes` fields
  - Zod validation implemented for asset POST requests (lib/validation.ts, app/api/assets/route.ts)
- Asset forms connected to backend API
- Asset add/edit forms now use react-hook-form with Zod validation for real-time feedback (components/add-asset-form.tsx, components/edit-asset-form.tsx)
- Pie chart now fetches live data from `/api/assets`
- Drizzle migrations updated with latest schema, including `0001_soft_sunset_bain.sql`

## Next Steps
1. Add error boundary components for improved error handling
2. Add chart data fetching from live asset data
3. Write integration and smoke tests
4. Refine dashboard and layout responsiveness
