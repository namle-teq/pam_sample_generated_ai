# Current Focus

## Active Development Areas
1. Asset CRUD API endpoints
2. Dashboard data visualization
3. Responsive layout refinements
4. Integration and smoke testing

## Recent Changes
- Database schema finalized in `lib/schema.ts` with:
  - Users table (email/password auth)
  - Assets table with numeric precision fields
  - Added `purchaseDate` (timestamp) and `notes` (optional text) fields to assets
  - Proper timestamp columns
- API endpoints updated for asset CRUD operations:
  - All endpoints now require authentication (returns 401 if not authenticated)
  - Asset creation (POST) now supports `purchaseDate` and `notes` fields
  - Zod validation planned for asset POST requests (TODO)
- Asset forms connected to backend API
- Pie chart now fetches live data from `/api/assets`
- Drizzle migrations updated with latest schema, including `0001_soft_sunset_bain.sql`

## Next Steps
1. Connect asset forms to backend API
2. Add chart data fetching from live asset data
3. Write integration and smoke tests
4. Refine dashboard and layout responsiveness
