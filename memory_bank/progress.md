# Development Progress

## Implemented Features
- Authentication UI (login/register forms)
- JWT authentication flow (lib/auth.ts, complete)
  - Session cookies use SameSite: "strict"
  - Token validation checks user existence
  - Redirects after login/register
- Asset CRUD form components connected to backend API
- Dashboard with live data fetching from `/api/assets`
- Full-stack data persistence layer
- API endpoints for asset operations (all endpoints require authentication; asset creation supports `purchaseDate` and `notes`)
- Database schema and migrations
  - Added `purchaseDate` and `notes` fields to assets
  - New migration: `0001_soft_sunset_bain.sql`

## Pending Features
1. Comprehensive error handling system
2. Loading states for API interactions
3. Form validation improvements
4. Integration and smoke testing
5. Chart data fetching from live data

## Known Issues
- Form validation not connected
- Chart uses static data
- No loading states
- Missing test coverage
- Session persistence improvements need verification through testing
